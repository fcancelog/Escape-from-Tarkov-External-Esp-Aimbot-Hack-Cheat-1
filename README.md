## Disclaimer
I also wanted to try out some Evasion Techniques. If you want a really secure cheat loader the code and logic should really be improved and you would have to add some features to secure it. I would advise you to create your own with the only goal to safely distribute your cheat. Check the link below if you really want to create your own and learn game hacking. (Btw I would not advise you to use SSL for a paycheat, no need to reinvent the wheel just use HTTPS). Anyway it will still work fine and provide very basic security features if you do not sell extremely expensive cheats and don't want to create your own. It's currently more like a dll injector than a loader
